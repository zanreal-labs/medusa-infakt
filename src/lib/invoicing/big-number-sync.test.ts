/**
 * DRIFT GUARD.
 *
 * `big-number.ts` and `big-number.fixtures.json` are vendored byte-for-byte
 * into three repos - see the header comment in `big-number.ts` for the full
 * vendoring contract:
 *
 *   - zanreal-labs/medusa-allegro  @ src/lib/sync/big-number.ts + big-number.fixtures.json       (canonical)
 *   - zanreal-labs/medusa-infakt   @ src/lib/invoicing/big-number.ts + big-number.fixtures.json  (this repo)
 *   - zanreal-labs/medusa-marken   @ src/lib/big-number.ts + big-number.fixtures.json
 *
 * Vendoring by copy-paste is enforced by nothing on its own: the first person
 * who patches one repo under time pressure silently reintroduces the exact
 * three-copies-drift bug this file structure exists to prevent (allegro#9,
 * infakt#5, marken#2), and nothing goes red. THIS TEST is the mechanical
 * guard - it hashes both files on disk and fails loudly the moment either one
 * changes here without the same change landing in the other two.
 *
 * `CANONICAL_HASH` below is THE SAME VALUE in all three repos' copies of this
 * test file. To change `big-number.ts` or `big-number.fixtures.json`:
 *
 *   1. Edit the canonical copy in medusa-allegro
 *      (src/lib/sync/big-number.ts, src/lib/sync/big-number.fixtures.json).
 *   2. Copy both files verbatim to:
 *        - medusa-infakt @ src/lib/invoicing/big-number.ts (+ .fixtures.json)
 *        - medusa-marken @ src/lib/big-number.ts (+ .fixtures.json)
 *   3. Recompute the hash (run this test - a mismatch prints the recomputed
 *      value) and paste it into `CANONICAL_HASH` in all three copies of this
 *      test file.
 *   4. Open all three PRs together.
 *
 * This does not make the sync automatic - nothing short of a published
 * package does that (see `big-number.ts`'s header for why that trade-off was
 * rejected here). It makes an unsynced edit fail in the repo where it
 * happened, with a message pointing at the other two, instead of drifting
 * silently.
